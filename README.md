# ToyRobot

Coding challenge from AUCLOUD.  

The problem has been solved in Ruby. I had access to a windows OS laptop. 

##SetUp

1. Please make Ruby version Ruby 2.7.2 is installed on your machine. 
	
   (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

2. gem install bulder -v 2.2.3 and gem install rspec


3. clone Repository https://github.com/KarthickNarayana/toy_robot.git

3. Run the program by 

	cd to toy_robot 

   bundle exec ruby exe/toy_robot.rb exe/commands.txt


   The project has a directory called exe and we can place all our commands in text file in that directory. 

   The output should be on the cmd prompt.  commands.txt and commands.01 are two files with commands.  


4. Test cases: from root of the project

	bundle exec rspec spec


It would be very convienient to view the code in an editor like RubyMine.  This makes execution or installing dependencies easier.
